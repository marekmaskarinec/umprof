# UmProf

A simple profiler for umka. Can be used as a library, or as a standalone
program. See main.c as an example usage of the library. See `umprof.h` for
further documentation.

## Bugs, problems:
	* sometimes segfaults (umka-lang/tests/all.um)
	* the memory usage grows with the number of calls
